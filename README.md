# AFrame Milky Way Scene

###### [@rajusajja](https://github.com/rajusajja) and I created a simple space scene using AFrame 

We incorporated spheres and toruses textured to represent planets in the solar system with a [360 
degree panoramic photo](https://imgur.com/niHC9wI) of the Milky Way as the background.

Also, we loaded a model from [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/models/587941c9c11742c6b82dfb99e7b210b9) of a spaceship, which is floating up
and down. We created an interaction in which you can make the planets and
rings shrink until they disappear, as if you were the pilot of the ship.

In the background, ["When You Wish Upon a Star"](https://ucarecdn.com/514cb51f-6b5e-484d-aa5f-f5572d3188b5/) from *Pinocchio* is playing
