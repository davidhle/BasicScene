# AFrame Milky Way Scene

[@rajusajja](https://github.com/rajusajja) and I created a simple scene using AFrame where we incorporated
spheres and toruses textured to represent planets in the solar system, with
a 360 panoramic photo of the Milky Way as the background.

Also, there is a model from SketchFab of a spaceship, which is floating up
and down. We created an interaction in which you can make the planets and
rings shrink until they disappear, as if you were the pilot of the ship.

In the background, "When You Wish Upon a Star" from *Pinocchio*
